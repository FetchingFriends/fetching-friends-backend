## About 

Fetching Friends is an application designed to help you find your next pet! Future pet parents have the ability to search through the available pets based on certain criteria you are looking for. Once a desired pet is found, you can submit an application straight to the owner to apply for your furry friend. This application also caters towards the needs of someone who has a pet to offer for adoption by giving them a platform to post their animals.

This repo is holds the back-end for Fetching Friends and is consumed by our front-end. The front-end repo can be found [here](https://github.com/FetchingFriends/fetching-friends-ui).
